## Great idea!  

It's very interesting to compare rates of ridership for subscribers and customers.  If your idea is that customers are less likely than subscribers to use the bike service, do you want to just look at proportion of trips for each demographic that occur during the weekend?  That would tell you whether customers or subscribers have a higher proporiton of weekend trips, but says nothing about which group is more likely to use biking for commuting.

I like your bar plots...they are very illustrative.  I am a litte unsure about what is going on with the last plot though...why are your bars superimposed?

I would consider a t test since you are comparing sample means for two different samples, and you do not know if they come from the same underlying population.
