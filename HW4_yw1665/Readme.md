The homework 4 is completed by myself.

For the assignment 1, besides the 4 assigned distribution, I include another logestic distribution. I plot both each of the sample mean and the distribution of all sample means. I also finished the exra credit.

For the assignment 2, I downloaded two datasets (January 2016 - February 2016). Then, I finished the assignment according to the example. 

For the assignment 3, I calculated mean of the sample and then conducted the z-test.
